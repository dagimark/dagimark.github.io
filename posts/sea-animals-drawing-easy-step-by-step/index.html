While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=13-beach-sketch-color--pieterrioghnach>13+ Beach Sketch Color | PieterRioghnach<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#13-beach-sketch-color--pieterrioghnach>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/f6/de/33f6de34081943992659976bc40c2648.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.7cHDPcO3G9-Qy_EUb4evwgHaEK&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="13+ Beach Sketch Color | PieterRioghnach"><p><em>Source: pieterrioghnach.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What are wallpaper screens and why are they so popular?
