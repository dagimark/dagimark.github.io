While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=how-to-draw-a-realistic-manga-eye-12-steps-with-pictures>How To Draw A Realistic Manga Eye: 12 Steps (with Pictures)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-draw-a-realistic-manga-eye-12-steps-with-pictures>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.wikihow.com/images/6/6d/Draw-a-Realistic-Manga-Eye-Step-12-Version-2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.llfNWlnzSfV7eZ-eYALKKAHaFj&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="How to Draw a Realistic Manga Eye: 12 Steps (with Pictures)"><p><em>Source: wikihow.com</em></p><blockquote><p>eye draw realistic manga step steps eyebrow.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Anime: Animation, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sports, and more
