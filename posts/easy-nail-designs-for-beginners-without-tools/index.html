-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=easy-nail-art-for-beginners-step-by-step-tutorials--nail-art-for>Easy Nail Art For Beginners Step By Step Tutorials | Nail Art For<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#easy-nail-art-for-beginners-step-by-step-tutorials--nail-art-for>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/9f/6d/a49f6d0b010d61310d2a213923604ad6.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ByYV611XXonPBFJiIxryRAHaHT&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Easy Nail Art for Beginners Step By Step Tutorials | Nail art for"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>nail easy tools beginners without step nails simple tutorial designs diy striped tutorials cute cool manicure make.</p></blockquote><p>Anime wallpaper is a popular way to add some extra excitement to your home screen.
